    "# Predict Turbofan Degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, build a machine learning application to predict turbofan engine degradation. This application is structured into three important steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction Engineering\n",
    "- Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, create new labels from the data by using [Compose](https://compose.alteryx.com/). In the second step, generate features for the labels by using [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/). In the third step, search for the best machine learning pipeline using [EvalML](https://evalml.alteryx.com/). After working through these steps, you should understand how to build machine learning applications for real-world problems like forecasting demand."

    "Use a dataset provided by [NASA](https://www.kaggle.com/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps) simulating turbofan engine degradation. In the dataset, there is data about engines that have been monitored over time. Each engine had operational settings and sensor measurements recorded over a number of cycles. The remaining useful life (RUL) is the amount of cycles an engine has left before it needs maintenance. What makes this dataset special is that the engines run all the way until failure, giving us precise RUL information for every engine at every point in time. The model you build in this tutorial predicts RUL."

For example, the ranges could be manually defined (0 - 150, 150 - 300, etc.) or based on the quartiles from historical observations.

    "Let’s start by representing the data with an entity set. That way, you can generate features based on the relational structure of the dataset. You currently have a single table of records where one engine can have many records. This one-to-many relationship can be represented by normalizing an engine entity. The same can be done for other one-to-many relationships. Because you want to make predictions based on the engine, you should use this engine entity as the target entity for generating features."
