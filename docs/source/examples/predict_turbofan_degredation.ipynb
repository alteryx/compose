    "In the first step, create new labels from the data by using [Compose](https://compose.alteryx.com/). In the second step, generate features for the labels by using [Featuretools](https://featuretools.alteryx.com/). In the third step, search for the best machine learning pipeline using [EvalML](https://evalml.alteryx.com/). After working through these steps, you should understand how to build machine learning applications for real-world problems like forecasting demand.\n",

In the dataset, there is data about engines that have been monitored over time. Each engine had operational settings and sensor measurements recorded over a number of cycles. The remaining useful life (RUL) is the amount of cycles an engine has left before it needs maintenance. What makes this dataset special is that the engines run all the way until failure, giving us precise RUL information for every engine at every point in time. The model you build in this tutorial predicts RUL."
