    "The start time of the labeling process is known as the first cutoff time. You need data that exists before the first cutoff time to build features. You can use `minimum_data` in a label search to directly define the first cutoff time or the amount of data needed before the first cutoff time. Similarly, you can use `maximum_data` to directly define the last cutoff time. These parameters let you control when the labeling process starts and finishes."
